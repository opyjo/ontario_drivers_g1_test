        "Turning Techniques: Right Turns, Left Turns & Hand-over-Hand Steering",
      content:
        "Before you turn a corner, you need to know what is beside and behind you. Always check your mirrors and over your shoulder to make sure the way is clear and you have enough space to complete the move safely.\\n\\nGeneral Turning Principles:\\nTo turn a corner, signal well before the turn. When the way is clear, move into the proper lane, either the far right lane for a right turn or the far left lane in your direction for a left turn. Signal your turn and look from side to side and check your blind spots to make sure the way is clear.\\n\\nSlow down before you enter the turn; the sharper the turn, the slower you should go. To keep full control of the vehicle, finish braking before you turn the steering wheel.\\n\\nHand-over-Hand Steering:\\nFor a sharp turn, turn the steering wheel with one hand and cross the other hand over it. Grip the wheel on the other side and continue turning. This is called 'hand over hand steering.' When you have completed the turn, relax your grip on the steering wheel and let it slip or gently feed it through your hands to return to the straight-ahead position. Do not turn the steering wheel with one finger or the flat palm of your hand. Gradually increase speed as you complete the turn.\\n\\nImportant Safety Rule:\\nRemember, drivers often lose control of vehicles and skid because they try to do more than one thing at a time. Try not to brake and steer at the same time.\\n\\nRight Turns:\\nUnless signs or pavement markings tell you not to, always begin and end a right turn close to the right side of the road. To make a right turn, signal well before the turn and move into the right-hand lane when the way is clear. If the right-hand lane is not marked, keep as far to the right of the road as possible. Look ahead, left, right and left again before starting to turn. If you have not seen any smaller vehicles or pedestrians, check your right rear blind spot. Let cyclists, limited-speed motorcycles, or moped riders go through the intersection before you turn. When it is safe, complete your turn into the right-hand lane of the road you are entering.\\n\\nLeft Turns:\\nUnless signs or pavement markings tell you not to, always begin and end a left turn in the far left lane in your direction. To make a left turn, signal well before the turn and move into the far left lane when the way is clear. Look ahead, behind, left, right and left again and check your blind spots. Make your turn when the way is clear.\\n\\nImportant Left Turn Safety:\\nWhen you are stopped at an intersection waiting for approaching traffic to clear, don't turn your steering wheel to the left until you can complete the turn. With your wheels turned to the left, your vehicle could be pushed into the path of oncoming traffic.\\n\\nWhen two vehicles coming from opposite directions meet in an intersection waiting to turn left, each should turn to the left of the other after yielding the right-of-way to pedestrians and oncoming traffic.\\n\\nMotorcycles, bicycles, limited-speed motorcycles and mopeds turn left at intersections in the same way as larger vehicles. If you are making a left turn behind one of these vehicles, do not pull up beside it to make your turn at the same time. Stay behind and turn when the way is clear. Wait for the smaller vehicle to move right before you pass.",

      content:
        "Special turning situations require additional knowledge and skills beyond basic turning techniques.\\n\\nRight Turn on Red Light:\\nUnless a sign tells you not to, you may make a right turn facing a red light as long as you first come to a complete stop and wait until the way is clear. Remember to signal your turn and yield to pedestrians and others using the road.\\n\\nLeft Turn on Red Light:\\nYou may turn left from a one-way road to a one-way road on a red light after coming to a complete stop and making sure the way is clear. Yield to pedestrians and traffic.\\n\\nLeft-Turn Lanes:\\nSome roads have special lanes for vehicles turning left. At an intersection where left-turn lanes are marked on the pavement, make your turn from the marked lane. Keep this lane position as you turn onto the other road.\\n\\nTwo-Way Left-Turn Lanes:\\nThe centre lane of some roads is used as a two-way left-turn lane. This lets left-turning vehicles from both directions wait for a chance to turn without holding up traffic. To use a two-way, left-turn lane, follow these steps:\\n\\n1. Signal and move into the centre lane shortly before your turn. Slow down.\\n2. Carefully move forward to a spot opposite the road or driveway where you want to turn.\\n3. Make your turn when the way is clear.\\n\\nRemember that vehicles from the opposite direction also use this lane to turn left. As they wait in front of you, it may be hard for you to see oncoming traffic. Only go when you are sure the way is clear. These left-turn lanes are not to be used for passing.\\n\\nDifferent Road Configurations:\\nThe correct way to turn left varies depending on the type of roads you're turning between:\\n\\n• Two-way road to two-way road: Turn from the lane closest to the centre line to the lane right of the centre line, following a smooth arc. Then, when you can, move into the right curb lane.\\n\\n• Two-way road to one-way road: Turn from the lane closest to the centre line to the left curb lane.\\n\\n• One-way road to two-way road: Turn from the left curb lane to the lane just right of the centre line. Then, when you can, move into the right curb lane.\\n\\n• One-way road to one-way road: Turn from the left curb lane to the left curb lane.",

      title: "Roundabouts: Approaching, Entering, Navigating & Exiting Safely",
      content:
        "Roundabouts are circular intersections where traffic moves counter-clockwise around a central island. Understanding proper roundabout techniques is essential for safe navigation.\\n\\nApproaching a Roundabout:\\nAs you approach the roundabout, look for signage to choose your exit. Choose which lane to use as you would for any other intersection:\\n• Use the left lane to turn left or to go straight\\n• Use the right lane to turn right or to go straight\\n• Do not enter a roundabout from the right lane if you want to turn left\\n\\nCyclists generally keep to the centre of the appropriate lane, or dismount and use the roundabout as a pedestrian would. Slow down and watch for pedestrians on the approach to the yield line at the entrance of the roundabout. Stay in your lane.\\n\\nEntering the Roundabout:\\n• Visual checks: Do visual checks of all vehicles already in the roundabout and those waiting to enter (including cyclists)\\n• Look left: Traffic in the roundabout has the right-of-way. When preparing to enter the roundabout, pay special attention to the vehicles to your left. Adjust your speed or stop at the yield sign if necessary\\n• Adequate gap: Watch for a safe opportunity to enter the roundabout. Enter when there is an adequate gap in the circulating traffic flow. Don't enter directly beside another vehicle already in the roundabout, as that vehicle may be exiting at the next exit\\n• Travel counter-clockwise: Once in the roundabout, always keep to the right of the central island and travel in a counter-clockwise direction\\n• Keep moving: Once you are in the roundabout, do not stop except to avoid a collision; you have the right-of-way over entering traffic. Do not change lanes while in the roundabout. If in the inside lane and you miss your exit, you must continue around until you meet your exit again\\n\\nExiting the Roundabout:\\n• Signal: Be sure to signal your exit and watch for pedestrians\\n• Maintain your lane: Stay to the left if you entered from the left lane, or stay to the right if you entered from the right lane\\n• Maintain your position: Maintain your position relative to other vehicles\\n• Signal intent to exit: Once you have passed the exit before the one you want, use your right-turn signal\\n• Left lane exit: If exiting from the left lane, watch out for vehicles on the right that continue to circulate around the roundabout\\n\\nSpecial Situations:\\n• Large vehicles: Allow extra room alongside large vehicles (trucks and buses). Large vehicles may have to swing wide on the approach or within the roundabout. Give them plenty of room\\n• Emergency vehicles: If you are in a roundabout when an emergency vehicle approaches, exit at your intended exit and proceed beyond the traffic island before pulling over. If you have not entered the roundabout yet, pull over to the right if possible and wait until the emergency vehicle has passed\\n• Large vehicle operation: A driver negotiating a roundabout in a large vehicle (such as a truck or bus) may need to use the full width of the roadway, including the apron (a mountable portion of the centre island adjacent to the roadway) if provided. Prior to entering the roundabout, the vehicle may need to occupy both lanes. Give large vehicles plenty of room to manoeuvre\\n\\nNote: In some areas of Ontario, older 'traffic circles' exist. They are larger than roundabouts, allowing higher speeds, and force traffic to merge and weave. Modern roundabouts have a smaller inscribed circle diameter and use splitter islands (to deflect traffic) at the entry points to slow traffic speeds, or to provide pedestrian refuge. The entry is also controlled by the 'yield to the left' principle; cars circulating within the roundabout have the right-of-way over entering vehicles.",

      content:
        "Passing is changing lanes to move past a slower vehicle. While all public roads have speed limits, not all vehicles travel at the same speed. For example, cyclists, road service vehicles and drivers ahead that are preparing to turn are usually slower than the through traffic. You may want to pass some slow-moving vehicles when you are following them.\\n\\nGeneral Rule:\\nNever overtake and pass another vehicle unless you are sure you can do so without danger to yourself or others. Don't pass moving snow plows under any conditions. If in doubt, do not pass.\\n\\nPassing Steps:\\n1. Use your left-turn signal to show that you want to pass and check that the way is clear ahead and behind before moving into the passing lane\\n2. Watch for bicycles and small vehicles that may be hidden from view in front of the vehicle you are about to pass. Also watch for vehicles that may be turning left in front of you and vehicles or pedestrians entering the road from another road or driveway\\n3. Change lanes only after signalling. After overtaking, signal that you want to move back into the lane you started from, and when you can see the entire front of the vehicle you are passing in your inside mirror, make the lane change. Be careful not to cut off a vehicle by suddenly moving in front of it\\n4. If the vehicle you are passing speeds up, do not race. Go back to your original lane. And do not speed up when another driver is trying to pass you. It is unlawful and dangerous\\n\\nProhibited Passing Zones:\\n• Passing within 30 metres of a pedestrian crossover is not permitted\\n• Passing left of a centreline is not permitted 30 metres from a bridge, viaduct or tunnel\\n• Don't attempt to pass when approaching the crest of a hill or on a curve where your vision of oncoming traffic is obstructed and there is not enough clear distance ahead to pass in safety\\n\\nSpecial Considerations:\\n• When passing parked vehicles, watch carefully for people suddenly opening doors or for doors opened to load and unload\\n• Motorcycles, bicycles, limited-speed motorcycles and mopeds often need to pull to the left or right side of their lane to avoid dangerous road conditions or to be seen by other drivers. Do not take this as an invitation to pass in the same lane. If you do want to pass these vehicles, do so by changing lanes\\n• When faster traffic wants to pass you, move to the right and let it pass in safety\\n• When being passed on an undivided road where the passing driver has pulled into the opposite lane, pay attention to oncoming traffic and move closer to the right side of the lane. Be prepared to slow down to let the passing driver get in front of you more quickly to prevent a collision\\n\\nHigh-Speed Roads:\\nOn many high-speed roads with three or more lanes in each direction, trucks are not allowed to drive in the far left-hand lane. This means that the lane next to it is the truck passing lane. If you are in this lane and a truck wants to pass, move into the right-hand lane as soon as you can.\\n\\nPassing at Night:\\nBe very careful when you pass other vehicles at night. If you have to pass and the way is clear, follow these steps:\\n1. Switch your headlights to low beams as you approach a vehicle from behind\\n2. Signal, check your mirrors and blind spot, and pull out to pass. As you move alongside the vehicle you are passing, switch on your high beams. This will let you see more of the road ahead\\n3. When you can see all of the front of the vehicle you are passing in your rear view mirror, you are far enough ahead to pull back into the right lane. Remember to signal\\n\\nSpecial Passing Lanes:\\nSome roads have special passing or climbing lanes. These lanes let slower vehicles move into the right-hand lane so that faster ones can pass safely in the left lane. An advance sign tells drivers they will soon have a chance to pass. Another sign warns when the lane is ending so drivers in the right-hand lane can begin to merge safely with traffic in the left-hand lane.\\n\\nPassing on Shoulders and Right Side:\\n• You may drive on the right shoulder only to pass a vehicle turning left and only if the shoulder is paved\\n• You may not pass on the left shoulder, paved or not\\n• Most passing is done on the left. You may pass on the right on multi-lane or one-way roads and when overtaking a streetcar or a left-turning vehicle\\n• Passing on the right can be more dangerous than passing on the left. If you are driving in the left most lane with a slower vehicle in front of you, wait for the vehicle to move to the right. Do not suddenly change lanes and pass on the right; the driver in front may realize you want to pass and move to the right at the same time you do",
