        "Traffic laws include the traffic signs and lights, pedestrian signals and pavement markings that tell drivers and other road users what they must do in certain situations. This chapter shows you what many of those signs, lights and markings look like and explains what they mean to drivers.\n\nTraffic signs give you important information about the law, warn you about dangerous conditions and help you find your way. Signs use different symbols, colours and shapes for easy identification.\n\nFundamental Signs You Must Know:\n\nStop Sign\n<img src='/images/regulatory_signs/stop-sign.png' alt='Stop Sign' />\nA stop sign is eight-sided and has a red background with white letters. It means you must come to a complete stop. Stop at the stop line if it is marked on the pavement. If there is no stop line, stop at the crosswalk. If there is no crosswalk, stop at the edge of the sidewalk. If there is no sidewalk, stop at the edge of the intersection. Wait until the way is clear before entering the intersection.\n\nSchool Zone Sign\n<img src='/images/regulatory_signs/school-zone-sign.png' alt='School Zone Sign' />\nA school zone sign is five-sided and has a fluorescent yellow/green background with black symbols. It warns that you are coming to a school zone. Slow down, drive with extra caution and watch for children.\n\nYield Sign\n<img src='/images/regulatory_signs/yield-sign.png' alt='Yield Sign' />\nA yield sign is a triangle with a white background and a red border. It means you must let traffic in the intersection or close to it go first. Stop if necessary and go only when the way is clear.\n\nRailway Crossing Sign\n<img src='/images/regulatory_signs/railway-crossing-sign.png' alt='Railway Crossing Sign' />\nA railway crossing sign is X-shaped with a white background and red outline. It warns that railway tracks cross the road. Watch for this sign. Slow down and look both ways for trains. Be prepared to stop.\n\nThere are four other kinds of signs: regulatory, warning, temporary conditions and information and direction.",

        "Information and direction signs tell you about distances and destinations. They are usually rectangular with a green background and white letters. Other signs with different colours guide you to facilities, services and attractions.\n\nCommon Information and Direction Signs:\n\nDirection Signs\n<img src='[DIRECTION_SIGNS_PLACEHOLDER]' alt='Direction Signs' />\nShows directions to nearby towns and cities.\n\nDistance Signs\n<img src='[DISTANCE_SIGNS_PLACEHOLDER]' alt='Distance Signs' />\nShows the distances in kilometres to towns and cities on the road.\n\nFreeway Exit Signs\n<img src='[FREEWAY_EXIT_SIGNS_PLACEHOLDER]' alt='Freeway Exit Signs' />\nVarious exit signs are used on freeways. In urban areas, many exit ramps have more than one lane. Overhead and ground-mounted signs help drivers choose the correct lane to exit or stay on the freeway.\n\nAdvance Exit Signs\n<img src='[ADVANCE_EXIT_SIGNS_PLACEHOLDER]' alt='Advance Exit Signs' />\nAdvance signs use arrows to show which lanes lead off the freeway. Signs are also posted at the exit.\n\nExit Lane Indicators\n<img src='[EXIT_LANE_INDICATORS_PLACEHOLDER]' alt='Exit Lane Indicators' />\nSometimes one or more lanes may lead off the freeway. The arrows matching the exit lanes are shown on the advance sign in a yellow box with the word 'exit' under them.\n\nInterchange Numbers\n<img src='[INTERCHANGE_NUMBERS_PLACEHOLDER]' alt='Interchange Numbers' />\nFreeway interchanges or exits have numbers that correspond to the distance from the beginning of the freeway. For example, interchange number 204 on Highway 401 is 204 kilometres from Windsor, where the freeway begins. Distances can be calculated by subtracting one interchange number from another.\n\nVIA Route Signs\n<img src='[VIA_ROUTE_SIGNS_PLACEHOLDER]' alt='VIA Route Signs' />\nThe term 'VIA' is used to describe the roads that must be followed to reach a destination.\n\nRoundabout Exit Signs\n<img src='[ROUNDABOUT_EXIT_SIGNS_PLACEHOLDER]' alt='Roundabout Exit Signs' />\nShows the upcoming roundabout exits and where they will take you.\n\nDynamic Message Signs\n<img src='[DYNAMIC_MESSAGE_SIGNS_PLACEHOLDER]' alt='Dynamic Message Signs' />\nThese signs change according to traffic conditions to give drivers current information on delays and lane closures ahead.\n\nOff-Road Facilities\n<img src='[OFF_ROAD_FACILITIES_SIGN_PLACEHOLDER]' alt='Off-Road Facilities Sign' />\nShows off-road facilities such as hospitals, airports, universities or carpool lots.\n\nRailway Station Sign\n<img src='[RAILWAY_STATION_SIGN_PLACEHOLDER]' alt='Railway Station Sign' />\nShows route to passenger railway station.\n\nAirport Sign\n<img src='[AIRPORT_SIGN_PLACEHOLDER]' alt='Airport Sign' />\nShows route to airport.\n\nAccessible Facilities\n<img src='[ACCESSIBLE_FACILITIES_SIGN_PLACEHOLDER]' alt='Accessible Facilities Sign' />\nShows facilities that are accessible by wheelchair.\n\nOversize Load Sign\n<img src='[OVERSIZE_LOAD_SIGN_PLACEHOLDER]' alt='Oversize Load Sign' />\nD sign – Oversize load\n\nOther Signs:\n\nSlow-Moving Vehicle Sign\n<img src='[SLOW_MOVING_VEHICLE_SIGN_PLACEHOLDER]' alt='Slow-Moving Vehicle Sign' />\nThe \"slow-moving vehicle\" sign is an orange triangle with a red border. It alerts other drivers that the vehicle ahead will be travelling at 40 km/h or less. When on a road, farm tractors, farm implements/machinery, and vehicles not capable of sustaining speeds over 40 km/h must display the slow moving vehicle sign. Watch for these slow moving vehicles and reduce your speed as necessary.\n\nEDR Signs\n<img src='[EDR_SIGNS_PLACEHOLDER]' alt='EDR Signs' />\nEDR signs are used during the unscheduled closure of a provincial highway when OPP detour all traffic off the highway. The EDR markers are located along alternative routes and provide direction to motorists around the closure and back onto the highway.\n\nLong Commercial Vehicle (LCV)\n<img src='[LCV_SIGN_PLACEHOLDER]' alt='Long Commercial Vehicle Sign' />\nThis placard indicates a long commercial vehicle, which is a double trailer and can be up to 40 metres in length.

      content:
        "Traffic lights tell drivers and pedestrians what they must do at intersections and along roads. They tell road users when to stop and go, when and how to turn and when to drive with extra caution.\n\nBasic Traffic Light Colours:\n\nGreen Light\n<img src='[GREEN_LIGHT_PLACEHOLDER]' alt='Green Light' />\nA green light means you may turn left, go straight or turn right after yielding to vehicles and pedestrians already in the intersection. When turning left or right you must yield the right-of-way to pedestrians crossing the intersection.\n\nYellow Light\n<img src='[YELLOW_LIGHT_PLACEHOLDER]' alt='Yellow Light' />\nA yellow - or amber - light means the red light is about to appear. You must stop if you can do so safely; otherwise, go with caution.\n\nRed Light\n<img src='[RED_LIGHT_PLACEHOLDER]' alt='Red Light' />\nA red light means you must stop. Bring your vehicle to a complete stop at the stop line if it is marked on the pavement. If there is no stop line, stop at the crosswalk, marked or not. If there is no crosswalk, stop at the edge of the sidewalk. If there is no sidewalk, stop at the edge of the intersection.\n\nWait until the light changes to green and the intersection is clear before moving through it.\n\nUnless a sign tells you not to, you may turn right on a red light only after coming to a complete stop and waiting until the way is clear. You may also turn left on a red light if you are moving from a one-way road onto a one-way road, but you must come to a complete stop first and wait until the way is clear.\n\nLights and Arrows to Help Turning Vehicles:\n\nFlashing green lights and green arrows direct drivers who are turning.\n\nAdvance Green Light or Arrow\n<img src='[ADVANCE_GREEN_LIGHT_PLACEHOLDER]' alt='Advance Green Light' />\nWhen you face a flashing green light or a left-pointing green arrow and a green light, you may turn left, go straight ahead or turn right from the proper lane.

Vehicles turning left from the opposite direction may also be making left turns because they too face a left-turn green arrow.\n\nAfter the left-turn green arrow, a yellow arrow may appear. This means the green light is about to appear for traffic in one or both directions. Do not start your left turn. Stop if you can do so safely; otherwise, complete your turn with caution.\n\nYou can still turn left when the light is green, but only when the way is clear of traffic and pedestrians. If the light turns red when you are in the intersection, complete your turn when it is safe.\n\nPedestrians must not cross on a left-turn green arrow unless a pedestrian signal tells them to.\n\nTransit Priority Signals\n<img src='[TRANSIT_PRIORITY_SIGNALS_PLACEHOLDER]' alt='Transit Priority Signals' />\nTraffic and pedestrians must yield to public transit vehicles at a transit priority signal. The round signal is on top of a regular traffic signal and shows a white vertical bar on a dark background. This allows transit vehicles to go through, turn right or left, while all conflicting traffic faces a red light.\n\nFully Protected Left Turn\n<img src='[FULLY_PROTECTED_LEFT_TURN_PLACEHOLDER]' alt='Fully Protected Left Turn' />\nSome intersections have separate traffic lights for left-turning traffic and for traffic going through the intersection or turning right.\n\nWhen a left-turn green arrow appears for traffic in the left-turn lane, traffic going straight ahead or turning right will usually see a red light. You may turn left from the left-turn lane when you face a green arrow. Vehicles from the opposite direction may also be turning left.\n\nAfter the left-turn green arrow, a yellow light appears for left-turning vehicles only.\n\nAfter the yellow light, a red light appears for left-turning vehicles only. Traffic going straight ahead or turning right will face a green light or green arrows pointing straight ahead and to the right.\n\nIn these intersections, you may not begin turning left after the green light appears for traffic going straight ahead or turning right. If the light turns yellow while you are in the intersection, complete your turn with caution.\n\nFlashing Red Light\n<img src='[FLASHING_RED_LIGHT_PLACEHOLDER]' alt='Flashing Red Light' />\nYou must come to a complete stop at a flashing red light. Move through the intersection only when it is safe.\n\nFlashing Yellow Light\n<img src='[FLASHING_YELLOW_LIGHT_PLACEHOLDER]' alt='Flashing Yellow Light' />\nA flashing yellow light means you should drive with caution when approaching and moving through the intersection.\n\nBlank Traffic Lights\nDuring an electrical power loss, traffic lights at intersections will not work. Yield the right-of-way to vehicles in the intersection and to vehicles entering the intersection from your right. Go cautiously and use the intersection the same way you would use an intersection with all-way stop signs.\n\nTraffic Beacons:\n\nA traffic beacon is a single flashing light hung over an intersection or placed over signs or on obstacles in the road.\n\nFlashing Red Beacon\n<img src='[FLASHING_RED_BEACON_PLACEHOLDER]' alt='Flashing Red Beacon' />\nA flashing red beacon above an intersection or stop sign means you must come to a complete stop.

        "Understanding Pavement Marking Systems:\nPavement markings combine with road signs and traffic lights to give you important information about the direction of traffic and where you may and may not travel. They divide traffic lanes, show turning lanes, mark pedestrian crossings, indicate obstacles and tell you when it is not safe to pass.\n\nBasic Pavement Marking Colors:\n\n🟡 Yellow Lines:\nYellow lines separate traffic travelling in opposite directions. They indicate:\n• Centre of roadway\n• Left edge of your travel direction\n• No passing zones when solid\n• Passing allowed when broken (if safe)\n\n⚪ White Lines:\nWhite lines separate traffic travelling in the same direction. They indicate:\n• Lane divisions for same-direction traffic\n• Right edge of roadway\n• Crosswalks and stop lines\n• Parking spaces and restricted areas\n\nPassing Zone Markings:\n\n➖ Solid Yellow Line:\nA solid line at the left of your lane means it is unsafe to pass. You must not cross this line to pass other vehicles. This marking is used where:\n• Visibility is limited\n• Hills or curves restrict sight distance\n• Oncoming traffic zones are unsafe\n• Road conditions make passing dangerous\n\n- - - Broken Yellow Line:\nA broken line at the left of your lane means you may pass if the way is clear. You may cross broken lines to pass when:\n• You can see far enough ahead\n• No oncoming traffic is visible\n• You can complete pass safely\n• There are enough broken line segments ahead to complete pass\n\n➖ - - Combination Solid and Broken Lines:\nSometimes you'll see solid line on your side and broken line on the other side (or vice versa):\n• Solid line on your side: You cannot pass\n• Broken line on your side: You may pass if safe\n• This allows passing from one direction but not the other\n\nLane Control Markings:\n\n═══ Continuity Lines:\nBroken lines that are wider and closer together than regular broken lines are called continuity lines. When you see continuity lines:\n• On your left side: Your lane is ending or exiting - you must change lanes to continue in current direction\n• On your right side: Your lane will continue unaffected\n• Provides advance warning of lane changes required\n\nIntersection Markings:\n\n▬ Stop Line:\nA single white line painted across the road at an intersection shows where you must stop. Stop at:\n• The stop line if marked on road\n• The crosswalk if no stop line\n• Edge of sidewalk if no crosswalk\n• Edge of intersection if no sidewalk\n\n▬▬ Crosswalk:\nMarked by two parallel white lines painted across the road. However, crosswalks at intersections exist even when not marked. Crosswalks indicate:\n• Where pedestrians should cross\n• Where vehicles must yield to pedestrians\n• Legal pedestrian crossing areas\n\nDirectional Markings:\n\n↑ Lane Direction Arrows:\nWhite arrows painted on lanes mean you may move only in the direction of the arrow:\n• Straight arrow: Through traffic only\n• Left arrow: Left turn only\n• Right arrow: Right turn only\n• Combined arrows: Multiple directions allowed from lane\n\nSpecial Crossing Markings:\n\n✖ Pedestrian Crossover Markings:\nPedestrian crossovers are marked by two white double parallel lines across the road with an X in each lane approaching it. These markings combined with:\n• Specific signs\n• Overhead yellow lights\n• Indicate legal pedestrian crossing with right-of-way\n\nSpecial Purpose Markings:\n\n🚌 Transit and HOV Lane Markings:\nSpecial lanes may be marked with:\n• Diamond symbols for HOV lanes\n• Bus symbols for transit lanes\n• Bicycle symbols for bike lanes\n• Solid white lines separating special lanes\n\n🅿️ Parking Space Markings:\nWhite lines define:\n• Individual parking spaces\n• Parking area boundaries\n• Loading zones\n• No parking areas\n\nObstacle and Hazard Markings:\n\n🔶 Object Markings:\nTwo solid yellow lines painted on pavement guide traffic away from fixed objects such as:\n• Bridge piers\n• Concrete islands\n• Traffic barriers\n• Construction barriers\n\nYellow and black markings also painted on the objects themselves as warnings.\n\nAdvanced Pavement Markings:\n\n🔄 Roundabout Markings:\n• Curved arrows showing traffic flow direction\n• Yield lines at entry points\n• Lane division lines within roundabout\n• Exit arrows for leaving roundabout\n\n🚧 Construction Zone Markings:\n• Temporary yellow lines for lane shifts\n• Temporary barriers marked with reflectors\n• Arrow markings directing traffic flow\n• Temporary crosswalk markings\n\nReflective Properties:\n\nModern pavement markings include reflective materials that:\n• Improve visibility at night\n• Help in poor weather conditions\n• Guide drivers during rain when markings might be obscured\n• Provide better contrast in low light\n\nMaintenance and Visibility:\n\n• Worn markings may be harder to see but are still legally enforceable\n• Fresh markings may be especially slippery when wet\n• Snow and ice can obscure markings - drive more carefully\n• Wet roads can make markings less visible\n\nLegal Significance:\n\n• All pavement markings have legal authority\n• Crossing solid lines where prohibited can result in fines\n• Failing to follow lane direction arrows is a violation\n• Not stopping at stop lines can result in charges\n• Blocking crosswalks is illegal",
