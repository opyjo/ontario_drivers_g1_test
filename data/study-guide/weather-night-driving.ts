        "At night and in weather conditions such as rain, snow or fog, you cannot see as far ahead, even with headlights. Slow down when driving at night, especially on unlit roads and whenever weather conditions reduce your visibility.\n\nOverdriving your headlights: You are overdriving your headlights when you go so fast that your stopping distance is farther than you can see with your headlights. This is a dangerous thing to do, because you may not give yourself enough room to make a safe stop. Reflective road signs can mislead you as well, making you believe you can see farther than you really can. This may cause you to over-drive your headlights if you are not careful.\n\nNight driving requires extra caution because your depth perception, color recognition, and peripheral vision are all compromised in darkness. Your eyes need time to adjust to changing light conditions, and this adjustment period leaves you temporarily vulnerable.\n\nReduce your speed at night to compensate for reduced visibility. Even with headlights, your ability to see and react to hazards is significantly diminished. Objects that are clearly visible during the day may be nearly invisible at night, including pedestrians, cyclists, animals, and road obstacles.\n\nBe especially cautious on rural roads and highways where there is no street lighting. These roads often have unexpected curves, hills, or other hazards that become apparent only when your headlights illuminate them. Always drive at a speed that allows you to stop within the distance your headlights can illuminate.\n\nAvoid looking directly at oncoming headlights, as this can temporarily blind you and make it difficult to see the road ahead. Instead, focus on the right edge of the road and use your peripheral vision to monitor oncoming traffic.",

      content:
        "Glare is dazzling light that makes it hard for you to see and be aware what others around you are doing. It can be a problem on both sunny and overcast days, depending on the angle of the sun's rays and your surroundings. Glare can also be a problem at night when you face bright headlights or see them reflected in your rear view mirror.\n\nWhen meeting oncoming vehicles with bright headlights at night, look up and beyond and slightly to the right of the oncoming lights. In daytime glare, use your sun visor or keep a pair of good quality sunglasses in your vehicle. When you enter a tunnel on a bright day, slow down to let your eyes adjust to the reduced light. Remove your sunglasses and turn on your headlights.\n\nCut down glare at night by following the rules of the road for vehicle lights. Use your low-beam headlights within 150 metres of an oncoming vehicle or when following a vehicle within 60 metres. On country roads, switch to low beams when you come to a curve or hilltop so you can see oncoming headlights and won't blind oncoming drivers. If you can't see any headlights, switch back to high beams.\n\nDaytime glare management requires preparation and proper equipment. Quality sunglasses are essential for reducing sun glare, but they must be appropriate for driving - avoid sunglasses that are too dark or that distort colors. Polarized sunglasses can be particularly effective at reducing glare from wet roads and other reflective surfaces.\n\nKeep your windshield clean, both inside and outside. A dirty windshield can scatter light and increase glare effects. Replace windshield wipers regularly to ensure they clean effectively without streaking.\n\nBe aware that glare is often worst during dawn and dusk when the sun is low on the horizon. During these times, the sun may be directly in your line of sight, making it extremely difficult to see pedestrians, cyclists, and other vehicles. Reduce speed and increase following distance during these conditions.",

      title: "Fog Conditions: Safe Techniques & When to Stop Driving",
      content:
        "Fog is a thin layer of cloud resting on the ground. Fog can reduce visibility for drivers, resulting in difficult driving conditions. The best thing to do is to avoid driving in fog. Check weather forecasts and if there is a fog warning, delay your trip until it clears. If that is not possible or you get caught driving in fog, there are a number of safe driving tips you should follow. If visibility is decreasing rapidly, move off the road and into a safe parking area to wait for the fog to lift.\n\nDO: Slow down gradually and drive at a speed that suits the conditions. Make sure the full lighting system of your vehicle is turned on. Use your low-beam headlights. High beams reflect off the moisture droplets in the fog, making it harder to see. If you have fog lights on your vehicle, use them, in addition to your low beams. Be patient. Avoid passing, changing lanes and crossing traffic. Use pavement markings to help guide you. Use the right edge of the road as a guide, rather than the centre line. Increase your following distance. You will need extra distance to brake safely. Look and listen for any hazards that may be ahead. Reduce the distractions in your vehicle. For example, turn off the cell phone. Your full attention is required. Watch for any electronically operated warning signs. Keep looking as far ahead as possible. Keep your windows and mirrors clean. Use your defroster and wipers to maximize your vision. If the fog is too dense to continue, pull completely off the road and try to position your vehicle in a safe parking area. Turn on your emergency flashers, in addition to keeping on your low-beam headlights.\n\nDON'T: Don't stop on the travelled portion of the road. You could become the first link in a chain-reaction collision. Don't speed up suddenly, even if the fog seems to be clearing. You could find yourself suddenly back in fog. Don't speed up to pass a vehicle moving slowly or to get away from a vehicle that is following too closely.\n\nREMEMBER: Watch your speed. You may be going faster than you think. If so, reduce speed gradually. Leave a safe braking distance between you and the vehicle ahead. Remain calm and patient. Don't pass other vehicles or speed up suddenly. Don't stop on the road. If visibility is decreasing rapidly, pull off the road into a safe parking area and wait for the fog to lift. Use your low-beam lights.",

      title: "Rain Driving: Hydroplaning Prevention & Visibility Management",
      content:
        "Rain makes road surfaces slippery, especially as the first drops fall. With more rain, tires make less contact with the road. If there is too much water or if you are going too fast, your tires may ride on top of the water, like water skis. This is called hydroplaning. When this happens, control becomes very difficult. Make sure you have good tires with deep tread, and slow down when the road is wet.\n\nRain also reduces visibility. Drive slowly enough to be able to stop within the distance you can see. Make sure your windshield wipers are in good condition. If your wiper blades do not clean the windshield without streaking, replace them.\n\nIn rain, try to drive on clear sections of road. Look ahead and plan your movements. Smooth steering, braking and accelerating will reduce the chance of skids. Leave more space between you and the vehicle ahead in case you have to stop. This will also help you to avoid spray from the vehicle ahead that can make it even harder to see.\n\nAvoid driving in puddles. A puddle can hide a large pothole that could damage your vehicle or its suspension, or flatten a tire. The spray of water could obstruct the vision of adjacent motorists and result in a collision, cause harm to nearby pedestrians or drown your engine, causing it to stall. Water can also make your brakes less effective.\n\nHydroplaning occurs when a layer of water builds up between your tires and the road surface, causing you to lose contact with the pavement. This typically happens at speeds above 50 km/h on wet roads. The risk increases with worn tires, shallow tread depth, and standing water on the roadway.\n\nTo prevent hydroplaning, maintain proper tire pressure and ensure adequate tread depth. Tires with insufficient tread cannot channel water away effectively. Reduce speed significantly in wet conditions, especially through areas where water tends to accumulate. Avoid sudden steering inputs, acceleration, or braking that could break traction.\n\nIf you begin to hydroplane, ease off the accelerator and hold the steering wheel straight. Do not brake suddenly or turn sharply, as this can cause you to lose control completely. Wait for your tires to regain contact with the road surface before making any steering corrections.",

      content:
        "Avoid driving on flooded roads, water may prevent your brakes from working. If you must drive through a flooded stretch of road, test your brakes afterward to dry them out. Test your brakes when it is safe to do so by stopping quickly and firmly at 50 km/h. Make sure the vehicle stops in a straight line, without pulling to one side. The brake pedal should feel firm and secure, not spongy, that's a sign of trouble. If you still feel a pulling to one side or a spongy brake pedal even after the brakes are dry, you should take the vehicle in for repair immediately.\n\nWhen you encounter flooded roads, your first priority should be to find an alternate route. Even shallow water can be dangerous - as little as 15 cm of moving water can knock down an adult, and 60 cm can float most vehicles. Water depth can be deceptive, and road surfaces underneath may be washed out or damaged.\n\nIf you absolutely must cross a flooded area, proceed with extreme caution. Before entering the water, observe other vehicles crossing to gauge depth and current. Enter slowly and maintain a steady, moderate speed - too fast can create a wave that floods your engine, too slow may cause you to stall. Keep your engine running at all times.\n\nWhile crossing, maintain steady pressure on the accelerator to prevent water from backing up through the exhaust pipe. If your vehicle starts to float or you lose traction, do not panic. Try to steer toward higher ground or the direction of the current, but be prepared to abandon the vehicle if necessary.\n\nAfter successfully crossing, immediately test your brakes as described. Wet brakes are extremely dangerous as they may not work when you need them most. The brake testing procedure should be done in a safe area with no following traffic. If brakes don't respond normally, continue light braking while driving slowly until they dry out and function properly.\n\nNever attempt to cross flooded roads at night when you cannot accurately judge water depth or road condition. Turn around and find a safe alternate route. The phrase 'Turn Around, Don't Drown' applies to vehicles as well as pedestrians.",

        "Snow may be hard-packed and slippery as ice; rutted, full of hard tracks and gullies; or smooth and soft. Look ahead and anticipate what you must do based on the conditions. Slow down on rutted, snowy roads. Avoid sudden steering, braking or accelerating that could cause a skid. Do not use cruise control during times of snow and other inclement weather.\n\nAs temperatures drop below freezing, wet roads become icy. Sections of road in shaded areas or on bridges and overpasses freeze first. It is important to look ahead, slow down and anticipate ice. If the road ahead looks like black and shiny asphalt, be suspicious. It may be covered by a thin layer of ice known as black ice. Generally, asphalt in the winter should look gray-white in colour. If you think there may be black ice ahead, slow down and be careful.\n\nBlack ice is particularly dangerous because it's nearly invisible. It forms when temperatures hover around the freezing point and moisture on the road surface freezes into a thin, transparent layer. Black ice gets its name because you can see the black asphalt underneath, making it appear that the road is simply wet.\n\nCommon locations for black ice include bridges and overpasses (which freeze first due to cold air circulation underneath), shaded areas that don't receive direct sunlight, intersections where vehicles have polished the surface, and areas where water collects and drains across the roadway.\n\nWhen driving in snowy conditions, reduce your speed significantly and increase following distances to at least 8-10 seconds. Test your vehicle's traction carefully by gently applying brakes or trying to accelerate gradually in a safe area. This will give you a sense of how slippery conditions really are.\n\nAvoid sudden movements - steering, braking, and acceleration should all be gradual and smooth. Sharp inputs can easily break traction on snow and ice. If you must climb a hill in snow, maintain steady momentum without spinning your tires, which can dig ruts and reduce traction.\n\nWhen descending hills in snow, use engine braking by downshifting to a lower gear rather than relying solely on your brakes. This helps maintain control and prevents brake lockup.",

      title: "Skid Recovery: Prevention, Techniques & Anti-lock Brakes (ABS)",
      content:
        "A skid may happen when one or more tires lose their grip with the road's surface. Skids most often happen on a slippery surface, such as a road that is wet, icy or covered with snow, gravel or some other loose material. Most skids result from driving too fast for road conditions. Hard braking and overly aggressive turning or accelerating can cause your vehicle to skid and possibly go out of control.\n\nTo avoid a skid on a slippery road, drive at a reduced speed and operate the vehicle's controls in a smooth and constrained manner. Increasing tire forces, such as by braking or accelerating while steering may push tires even closer to a skid condition. It's essential that the vehicle's speed be maintained at a safe level and that turns be made gently.\n\nIf your vehicle begins to skid, try not to panic - it is possible to maintain control of your vehicle, even in a skid. Ease off on the accelerator or brake and on a very slippery surface slip the transmission into neutral if you can. Continue to steer in the direction you wish to go. Be careful not to oversteer. Once you regain control, you can brake as needed, but very gently and smoothly.\n\nAnti-lock braking systems (ABS): If your vehicle is equipped with anti-lock brakes, practise emergency braking to understand how your vehicle will react. It is a good idea to practise doing this under controlled conditions with a qualified driving instructor. ABS is designed to sense the speed of the wheels on a vehicle during braking. An abnormal drop in wheel speed, which indicates potential wheel lock, causes the brake force to be reduced to that wheel. This is how ABS prevents tire skid and the accompanying loss of steering control. This improves vehicle safety during heavy brake use or when braking with poor traction.\n\nAlthough anti-lock braking systems help to prevent wheel lock, you should not expect the stopping distance for your vehicle to be shortened. Drivers unfamiliar with anti-lock braking may be surprised by the pulsations that they may feel in the brake pedal when they brake hard. Make sure you know what to expect so you will not be distracted by the pulsation or tempted to release the pedal during emergency braking manoeuvres.\n\nThreshold braking should bring you to a reasonably quick controlled stop in your own lane, even in slippery conditions. This technique is generally practised in a vehicle that is not equipped with ABS. Brake as hard as you can until a wheel begins to lock up, then release pressure on the pedal slightly to release the wheel. Press down on the brake pedal, applying as much braking force as possible without inducing a skid. If you feel any of the wheels begin to lock up, release the brake pressure slightly and re-apply. Don't pump the brakes. Continue braking this way until you have slowed the vehicle to the desired speed.\n\nVehicles equipped with ABS should provide controlled braking on slippery surfaces automatically. Press the brake pedal hard and allow the system to control wheel lock-up.",

        "Snow-removal vehicles on public roadways are equipped with flashing blue lights that can be seen from 150 metres. Flashing blue lights warn you of wide and slow-moving vehicles: some snow plows have a wing that extends as far as three metres to the right of the vehicle. On freeways, several snow plows may be staggered across the road, clearing all lanes at the same time by passing a ridge of snow from plow to plow. Do not try to pass between them. This is extremely dangerous because there is not enough room to pass safely, and the ridge of wet snow can throw your vehicle out of control.\n\nBlowing snow may create whiteouts where snow completely blocks your view of the road. When blowing snow is forecast, drive only if necessary and with extreme caution. Before you drive - and during your trip - check weather forecasts and road reports. If there is a weather warning, or reports of poor visibility and driving conditions, delay your trip until conditions improve, if possible.\n\nIf you get caught driving in blowing snow or a whiteout, follow these safe driving tips: Slow down gradually and drive at a speed that suits the conditions.
