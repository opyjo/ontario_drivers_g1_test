        "Since parking rules change from road to road and place to place, always watch for and obey signs that say you may not stop or limit stopping, standing or parking. Be aware that not all parking by-laws are posted on signs.\\n\\nBasic Parking Rules:\\n‚Ä¢ Never park on the travelled part of a road. Drive off the road onto the shoulder if you must stop for some reason\\n‚Ä¢ Never park on a curve, hill or anywhere you do not have a clear view for at least 125 metres in both directions\\n‚Ä¢ Do not park where you will block a vehicle already parked or where you will block a sidewalk, crosswalk, pedestrian crossing or road entrance\\n\\nDistance Restrictions:\\n‚Ä¢ Do not park within three metres of a fire hydrant\\n‚Ä¢ Do not park on or within 100 metres of a bridge\\n‚Ä¢ Do not park within six metres of a public entrance to a hotel, theatre or public hall when it is open to the public\\n‚Ä¢ Do not park within nine metres of an intersection\\n‚Ä¢ Do not park within 15 metres of an intersection if it is controlled by traffic lights\\n‚Ä¢ Do not park within 15 metres of the nearest rail of a level railway crossing\\n‚Ä¢ Do not park where you will get in the way of traffic or snow clearing\\n\\nGeneral Safety Rules:\\n‚Ä¢ Never open the door of your parked vehicle without first making sure that you will not endanger any other person or vehicle or interfere with traffic\\n‚Ä¢ Generally, a good practice is to use the Dutch reach method, meaning you open the driver's door with your right hand as this will force a shoulder check at the same time\\n‚Ä¢ Take extra precautions to avoid opening a door in the path of cyclists, who often ride close to parked cars\\n‚Ä¢ When you must open a door next to traffic, keep it open only long enough to load or unload passengers\\n\\nAfter Parking:\\n‚Ä¢ Always turn off the ignition and the lights\\n‚Ä¢ Remove the key and lock the door to deter theft\\n‚Ä¢ Do not leave children or animals in the vehicle\\n‚Ä¢ Before moving from a parked position, always signal and check for traffic, pulling out only when it is safe to do so",

        "The Accessible Parking Permit, formerly known as the Disabled Person Parking Permit, is a laminated card that may be displayed on the dashboard or turned-down sun visor of any vehicle in which a person with a disability is travelling. The permit entitles the vehicle in which the person named on the permit is travelling to park in designated disabled parking, standing and stopping areas. The permit is issued to the permit holder, not a specific vehicle.\\n\\nPermit Qualification:\\nThe Accessible Parking Permit is issued free of charge to qualified individuals. To qualify for an Accessible Parking Permit, a licensed physician, chiropractor, nurse practitioner (extended class) physiotherapist or occupational therapist must certify that the applicant has one or more of the conditions detailed on the Accessible Parking Permit application form.\\n\\nTypes of Accessible Parking Permits:\\n\\n1. Regular permit (blue): Issued to people with permanent disabilities and is valid for five years. Until 2011, all individuals will need to be re-certified before renewing their permit. After that date, only individuals whose condition is deemed 'subject to change' will need to be re-certified before renewing their permit.\\n\\n2. Temporary permit (red): Issued when the disability is expected to last more than two months, but is not a permanent disability. The temporary permit is not renewable.\\n\\n3. Traveller permit (purple): Valid for up to one year and is issued upon request to individuals who hold a valid Accessible Parking Permit and plan to fly from any Ontario airport. The permit holder places the traveller permit on the dashboard or sun visor of their vehicle when leaving it parked at the airport. The person's regular permit travels with them.\\n\\n4. Company permit (green): Valid for up to five years and is issued to companies and non-profit organizations that own or lease vehicles used to transport people with physical disabilities.\\n\\nLegal Requirements:\\n‚Ä¢ Never park in a space designated for people with disabilities unless you display an Accessible Parking Permit in the windshield of your vehicle\\n‚Ä¢ The permit must belong to you or one of your passengers\\n‚Ä¢ This also applies to standing or stopping at curb areas reserved for picking up and dropping off passengers with disabilities\\n‚Ä¢ Misuse or abuse of an Accessible Parking Permit should be reported to the police\\n‚Ä¢ Misuse of an Accessible Parking Permit will result in fines and revoked privileges\\n\\nApplication Process:\\nAccessible Parking Permit applications are available at any Service Ontario Centre or by sending a request to the ministry at:\\nService Ontario\\nLicence Renewals Unit\\nP.O.

      title: "Parallel Parking: Step-by-Step Procedure & Positioning",
      content:
        "Parallel parking means parking a vehicle with its wheels parallel and next to the curb or side of the road. Park parallel to the curb on roads where parking is allowed, unless there are signs saying that vehicles should be parked at an angle. Park on the right side of the road in the direction of traffic. Unless there are signs saying otherwise, you can parallel park on both sides of a one-way road.\\n\\nFinding a Suitable Space:\\nTo parallel park on the right-hand side of the road, find a space that is about one and one-half times longer than your vehicle. Check the traffic beside and behind and signal your wish to pull over and stop. Drive alongside, or parallel to, the vehicle ahead of the empty space, leaving about a metre between the vehicles. Stop when your rear bumper is in line with the other vehicle.\\n\\nStep-by-Step Parallel Parking Procedure:\\n\\n1. Slowly and carefully reverse into the space, turning the steering wheel fully toward the curb\\n\\n2. When you can see the outside rear corner of the vehicle in front of your space, straighten your wheels as you continue to reverse\\n\\n3. Turn the steering wheel fully toward the road to bring your vehicle in line with the curb\\n\\n4. If your vehicle is not parallel to the curb, drive forward to straighten\\n\\n5. When you are properly parked, set the parking brake and move the gear selector into park, or shift into first or reverse gear if your vehicle has a manual transmission\\n\\n6. Turn off the engine. Remember to remove the key from the ignition\\n\\n7. Check traffic before opening your door\\n\\n8. Lock your vehicle\\n\\nKey Positioning Tips:\\n‚Ä¢ Position your vehicle parallel to the vehicle in front of the space\\n‚Ä¢ Leave about one metre between vehicles when starting\\n‚Ä¢ Align your rear bumper with the other vehicle's rear bumper\\n‚Ä¢ Turn steering wheel fully toward curb when starting to reverse\\n‚Ä¢ Use reference points like the rear corner of the front vehicle to guide wheel straightening\\n‚Ä¢ Final positioning should be parallel to curb with appropriate spacing\\n‚Ä¢ Always check that you haven't blocked driveways or other vehicles",
