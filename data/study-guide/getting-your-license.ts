If you are applying for your first licence, this chapter explains the graduated licensing system, how to apply for a licence, the tests you will have to pass and the driving privileges you will have at each licence level.\n\nOntario residents must be at least 16 years old and must have a valid Ontario driver's licence. If you have just become an Ontario resident, you have 60 days to continue to use your existing driver's licence and apply for an Ontario driver's licence.\n\nVisitors to Ontario must be at least 16 years old, must have a valid driver's licence from your home province, state or country, and must have an international driver's permit from your own country if visiting Ontario for more than 3 months. Visitors are not eligible for an Ontario driver's licence.\n\nYou do not need a licence to ride a bicycle in Ontario; however bicycles are defined as vehicles in the Highway Traffic Act and bicyclists have rights and responsibilities similar to other vehicle operators under the Act. Information on safe cycling can be found in the Ministry of Transportation publications Cycling Skills and the Young Cyclist Guide.",

        "In Ontario, there are 12 different classes of licences. Each one qualifies you to drive a different type of vehicle. The class of licence you have must match the type of vehicle you are driving. You need a Class G licence to drive a car, van or small truck. You must have a Class G licence before you can be licensed to drive any other type of vehicle. The only exception is motorcycles. You may get a motorcycle licence (Class M) without first getting a Class G licence.\n\nThe Driver's Licence Classification Chart shows you what class of licence you need to drive different vehicles. For information on the skills and knowledge you'll need to get a Class M motorcycle licence, study the Official MTO Motorcycle Handbook. You can get information on other kinds of licences - classes A, B, C, D, E and F - in the Official MTO Truck Handbook and the Official MTO Bus Handbook. If you want to drive a vehicle equipped with air brakes, the Official MTO Air Brake Handbook tells you how to qualify.\n\nSome recreational vehicles have special licence requirements. If you plan to drive an off-road vehicle or snowmobile, read the Off-Road Vehicles section in this handbook. Recreational vehicles exceeding 11,000 kilograms but below 14,000 kilograms can be driven with a Class G, E or F licence with RV endorsement. Recreational vehicles of any weight, including those exceeding 14,000 kilograms, can be driven with a Class A, B, C or D licence, or a Class D licence with RV restriction.",

However, the ministry may accept an applicant's declaration of their foreign-licensed driving experience for up to 12 months.\n\nFor more than 12 months' experience, applicants must provide an authenticated letter from their embassy/ consulate or licencing agency in English or French. A full 24 months of Ontario and foreign experience is required prior to attempting their G2 exit test.\n\nOnly experience within the past three years may be credited.\n\nDriving customs vary from place to place.

The BDE course may also make you eligible to take your road test sooner and allow you to save money on insurance premiums.\n\nAs well as teaching the basics, driver training emphasizes strategic driving techniques, positive driving attitudes and behaviour, avoiding driver distractions, risk perception and management, freeway driving, night driving and driving in adverse conditions. Most programs are designed for new drivers, but many driving schools also provide courses and services to upgrade your skills.\n\nIf you graduate from an approved BDE course, this will be noted in your driver's licence history, and will reduce the time you must spend at Level 1 by four months. It may also bring you savings on your car insurance.\n\nAll ministry-licenced driving schools offer in-class and in-car training for a fee. All lessons are taught by a ministry-licensed driving instructor.\n\nMinistry-approved BDE courses, offered by driving schools, must last a minimum of 40 hours.
