      content:
        "There are two main types of intersections: controlled and uncontrolled. Understanding the difference is crucial for safe driving.\\n\\nControlled Intersections:\\nControlled intersections have traffic lights, yield signs or stop signs to control traffic. These are the most common type of intersections, especially in urban areas.\\n\\nAt a controlled intersection where you face a green light, drive carefully through the intersection at a steady speed. If the light has been green for a while, be prepared to stop when it turns yellow. However, if you are already so close that you cannot stop safely, drive through the intersection with caution. Where you face a red light, come to a complete stop and wait until the light turns green.\\n\\nWhen you approach an intersection on a main road, and the intersection is blocked with traffic, stop before entering the intersection and wait until the traffic ahead moves on. This does not apply if you are turning left or right.\\n\\nAt a controlled intersection where you face a yield sign, slow down or stop if necessary and wait until the way is clear before driving through the intersection.\\n\\nAt a controlled intersection where you face a stop sign, come to a complete stop. Drive through the intersection only when the way is clear.\\n\\nUncontrolled Intersections:\\nUncontrolled intersections have no signs or traffic lights. They are usually found in areas where there is not much traffic. Be extra careful around these intersections. If two vehicles come to an uncontrolled intersection from different roads at the same time, the driver on the left must let the driver on the right go first. This is called yielding the right-of-way.\\n\\nBe alert as you come to intersections and look carefully for pedestrians, cyclists, other motor vehicles, yield signs, stop signs and traffic lights. Be sure to scan any sidewalks and paths/trails as well as the roadways. Bear in mind that children are often unaware of traffic laws and also that cycling on the sidewalk may be permitted by local bylaw.",

      content:
        "There are times when you must yield the right-of-way. This means you must let another driver go first. Understanding these rules prevents collisions and keeps traffic flowing smoothly.\\n\\nBasic Right-of-Way Rules:\\n\\nAt an intersection without signs or lights, you must yield the right-of-way to a vehicle approaching the intersection before you, and if you arrive at the same time, the vehicle approaching from the right has the right-of-way.\\n\\nAt an intersection with stop signs at all corners, you must yield the right-of-way to the first vehicle to come to a complete stop. If two vehicles stop at the same time, the vehicle on the left must yield to the vehicle on the right.\\n\\nTurning Movements:\\nAt any intersection where you want to turn left or right, you must yield the right-of-way. If you are turning left, you must wait for approaching traffic to pass or turn and for pedestrians in or approaching your path to cross. If you are turning right, you must wait for pedestrians to cross if they are in or approaching your path. You should also check your blind spot for cyclists approaching from behind, particularly in a bike lane to your right, on a sidewalk or a trail.\\n\\nA yield sign means you must slow down or stop if necessary and yield the right-of-way to traffic in the intersection or on the intersecting road.\\n\\nEntering from Private Property:\\nWhen entering a road from a private road or driveway, you must yield to vehicles on the road and pedestrians on the sidewalk.\\n\\nPedestrian Right-of-Way:\\nYou must yield the right-of-way and wait for pedestrians to completely cross the road at pedestrian crossovers and school crossings with crossing guards.\\n\\nImportant Reminder:\\nSignalling does not give you the right-of-way. You must make sure the way is clear before proceeding, regardless of your signal.",

      content:
        "Traffic control devices are essential for safe and orderly traffic movement. Proper compliance with these devices is not just legally requiredâ€”it saves lives.\\n\\nStop Signs:\\nYou must come to a complete stop for all stop signs. Stop at the stop line if it is marked on the pavement. If there is no stop line, stop at the crosswalk, marked or not. If there is no crosswalk, stop at the edge of the sidewalk. If there is no sidewalk, stop at the edge of the intersection. Wait until the way is clear before entering the intersection.\\n\\nThe key word is 'complete' stop. Rolling stops are illegal and dangerous. Your vehicle must come to a full stop, with no forward movement, before proceeding.\\n\\nTraffic Lights:\\nTraffic lights control the flow of traffic at intersections. Understanding what each light means and how to respond is crucial:\\n\\nGreen Light: Proceed with caution if the intersection is clear. Even with a green light, you must yield to pedestrians and vehicles already in the intersection.\\n\\nYellow Light: The light is about to turn red. If you can stop safely, you should. If you're too close to stop safely, proceed with caution.\\n\\nRed Light: Come to a complete stop and remain stopped until the light turns green. Right turns on red are permitted after a complete stop, unless signs prohibit it, but you must yield to pedestrians and other traffic.\\n\\nYield Signs:\\nA yield sign means you must slow down or stop if necessary and yield the right-of-way to traffic in the intersection or on the intersecting road. Unlike a stop sign, you don't have to come to a complete stop if the way is clear, but you must be prepared to stop.\\n\\nProper Stopping Technique:\\nKnowing how to stop safely and properly is an important driving skill. Safe and responsible drivers see stops ahead, check their mirrors, begin braking early and stop smoothly. Use your right foot for both brake and gas pedals so you won't step on both pedals at the same time. Press the brake pedal firmly and evenly.",

The law requires you to:\\n\\n1. Yield the right-of-way to pedestrians in the crossover\\n2. Come to a complete stop if a pedestrian is crossing or about to cross\\n3. Remain stopped until the pedestrian has completely crossed your lane and the adjacent lane\\n4. Do not proceed until the pedestrian is completely clear of your direction of travel\\n5. Never pass a vehicle that has stopped at a pedestrian crossover\\n\\nSafety Considerations:\\nPedestrians at crossovers may include people with visual impairments using guide dogs or white canes, individuals using mobility devices, elderly persons, or children. Exercise extra caution and patience.\\n\\nRemember that pedestrian crossovers give pedestrians the legal right-of-way, but pedestrians should still ensure that drivers have seen them and are stopped before entering the roadway. Eye contact between the pedestrian and driver is one of the keys to pedestrian safety.\\n\\nPenalties for violations at pedestrian crossovers are severe, including substantial fines and demerit points.

All are chrome yellow and display the words 'School Bus.' They are equipped with:\\n- Upper alternating red flashing lights\\n- A stop sign arm on the driver's side\\n- Reflective tape and markings for visibility\\n\\nWhen You Must Stop:\\nYou must stop whenever you approach a stopped school bus with its upper alternating red lights flashing, regardless of whether you are behind the bus or approaching it from the front.\\n\\nStopping Distances:\\n- When approaching the bus from the front: Stop at a safe distance for children to get off the bus and cross the road in front of you\\n- When coming from behind the bus: Stop at least 20 metres away\\n- Do not proceed until the bus moves or the lights have stopped flashing\\n\\nStop Sign Arm:\\nAs well as the upper alternating red flashing lights, school buses use a stop sign arm on the driver's side of the bus. This arm is a standard stop sign with alternating flashing red lights at top and bottom. The arm swings out after the upper alternating red lights begin to flash. Remain stopped until the arm folds away and all lights stop flashing.\\n\\nMedian Strip Exception:\\nIf you are on a road with a median strip, only vehicles coming from behind the bus must stop. (A median is a physical barrier such as a raised, lowered, earth or paved strip constructed to separate traffic travelling in different directions. Vehicles cannot cross over a median strip.)\\n\\nGeneral Rules:\\n- You must obey the school bus law on any road, no matter how many lanes or what the speed limit\\n- Be prepared to stop for a school bus at any time, not just within school hours\\n- School buses must stop at all railway crossings (upper red lights not used for these stops)\\n\\nPenalties:\\nIt is illegal to fail to stop for a stopped school bus that has its red lights flashing.

Slow down, listen and look both ways to make sure the way is clear before crossing the tracks\\n2. If a train is coming, stop at least five metres from the nearest rail or gate\\n3. Do not cross the track until you are sure the train or trains have passed\\n4. Never race a train to a crossing - trains always win\\n5. If there are signal lights, wait until they stop flashing\\n6. If the crossing has a gate or barrier, wait until it rises before crossing\\n7. Never drive around, under or through a railway gate or barrier while it is down, being lowered or being raised - it is illegal and dangerous\\n8. Avoid stopping in the middle of railway tracks\\n9. In heavy traffic, make sure you have enough room to cross completely before you begin\\n10. Avoid shifting gears while crossing tracks\\n\\nEmergency Procedures:\\nIf you get trapped on a crossing:\\n1. Immediately get everyone out and away from the vehicle\\n2. Move to a safe place\\n3. Contact authorities immediately\\n\\nSpecial Vehicle Requirements:\\nMost buses and other public vehicles are required to stop at railway crossings that are not protected by gates, signal lights or a stop sign. School buses must stop at railway crossings whether or not they are protected. Watch for these buses and be prepared to stop behind them.\\n\\nStop Sign Crossings:\\nIf you are approaching a railway crossing with a stop sign, you must stop unless otherwise directed by a flagman.\\n\\nCritical Facts:\\nRemember it can take up to two kilometres for a train to stop under full emergency braking. Trains are much wider than they appear and may extend beyond the rails. Multiple tracks mean multiple dangers - a second train may be coming from the opposite direction.",
