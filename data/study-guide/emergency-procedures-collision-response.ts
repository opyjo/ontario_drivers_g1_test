      content:
        "Vehicle malfunctions can happen suddenly and require quick, proper responses to prevent serious accidents. Knowing how to handle these emergencies can save lives.\n\nBrake Failure:\nIf your brakes fail, try pumping the brake pedal to temporarily restore hydraulic brake pressure. If this does not work, apply the parking brake gently but firmly while holding the release button. It is a good idea for new drivers to practice a parking-brake emergency stop under controlled conditions with a qualified driving instructor. Total brake failure is very rare on modern vehicles. If your brakes do fail and you manage to stop, do not drive away. Call for help.\n\nStuck Gas Pedal:\nIf your gas pedal sticks, first try to lift the pedal by slipping your foot under it. Do not reach down with your hands while the vehicle is moving. If this does not work, turn on your hazard lights, shift to neutral and stop as soon as you safely can, preferably off the road. Turn off the ignition and do not drive away. Call for help.\n\nHeadlight Failure:\nIf your headlights go out, check the switch immediately. If the lights stay out, turn on your hazard lights and bring your vehicle to a safe stop off the road. Call for help. It is dangerous and illegal to drive at night without lights.\n\nGeneral Emergency Response:\nIn any vehicle malfunction emergency:\n- Stay calm and think clearly\n- Get the vehicle safely off the road if possible\n- Turn on hazard lights immediately\n- Do not attempt to drive the vehicle until the problem is professionally diagnosed and repaired\n- Call for professional assistance\n- If the situation is dangerous, call emergency services",

      content:
        "Freeway breakdowns are particularly dangerous due to high-speed traffic. Proper procedures can prevent secondary accidents and keep you safe while waiting for help.\n\nBreakdown Procedures:\nAt the first sign of trouble, begin to pull over. Do not wait for your vehicle to stall on the freeway. Check your mirrors, put on your hazard lights, take your foot off the gas pedal and pull over to the nearest shoulder as quickly as possible. Never stop in the driving lanes.\n\nSafe Positioning:\nBe careful getting out of your vehicle. If possible, leave through the door away from traffic. Do not raise the hood as this can obstruct visibility and create additional hazards.\n\nWaiting for Help:\nWhile you wait for help, stay in your vehicle with the doors locked. If someone stops to help, ask them to call the police or automobile club for you. If you have a cellular phone, call for help yourself. The Queen Elizabeth Way, the 400-series freeways and many other high-speed roads are patrolled by the Ontario Provincial Police. Stay with your vehicle, and help will arrive shortly.\n\nVisibility and Safety:\nKeep your hazard lights flashing continuously. If you have reflective triangles or flares, place them well behind your vehicle to warn approaching traffic, but only if you can do so safely without exposing yourself to traffic.\n\nEmergency Equipment:\nAlways carry emergency equipment in your vehicle:\n- Charged cellular phone\n- Reflective triangles or emergency flares\n- First aid kit\n- Blanket\n- Flashlight with fresh batteries\n- Emergency contact numbers\n\nSpecial Considerations:\nNever attempt repairs on a busy freeway. Even simple fixes like changing a tire can be extremely dangerous due to high-speed traffic passing very close to the shoulder.",

      content:
        "Off-road emergencies require specific techniques to regain control safely and prevent rollovers or further loss of control.\n\nWheels Off Pavement:\nIf your wheels go off the pavement, don't panic. Grip the steering wheel firmly. Take your foot off the gas pedal to slow down. Avoid heavy braking, as this can cause loss of control or cause the vehicle to flip. When the vehicle is under control, steer toward the pavement. Be prepared to correct your steering and increase speed when your wheels are fully back on the pavement.\n\nStep-by-Step Recovery:\n1. Don't panic - maintain calm control\n2. Grip steering wheel firmly with both hands\n3. Take foot off gas pedal gradually\n4. Avoid heavy braking or sudden steering movements\n5. Keep the vehicle straight until speed decreases\n6. When under control, gradually steer back toward pavement\n7. Be ready to counter-steer once back on pavement\n8. Gradually increase speed to match traffic flow\n\nTire Blowouts:\nBlowouts can cause tremendous steering and wheel vibration, but don't be alarmed. Take your foot off the gas pedal to slow down and steer the vehicle firmly in the direction you want to go. Bring the vehicle to a stop off the road.\n\nBlowout Response:\n1. Don't panic despite loud noise and vibration\n2. Grip steering wheel firmly\n3. Take foot off gas pedal immediately\n4. Don't brake suddenly - this can cause loss of control\n5. Steer firmly in direction you want to go\n6. Counter any pulling from the damaged tire\n7. Gradually slow down using light braking\n8. Pull safely off the road when speed is controlled\n9. Turn on hazard lights\n10. Call for assistance - don't attempt tire change on busy roads\n\nPrevention:\nRegular tire maintenance helps prevent blowouts:\n- Check tire pressure monthly\n- Inspect for wear, cracks, or embedded objects\n- Rotate tires according to manufacturer recommendations\n- Replace tires when tread is worn\n- Don't overload your vehicle beyond its capacity",

      content:
        "Collisions involving injuries require immediate and specific responses to save lives and comply with legal requirements. St. John Ambulance recommends that all drivers carry a well-stocked first-aid kit and know how to use it.\n\nImmediate Response:\nEvery driver involved in a collision must stay at the scene or return to it immediately and give all possible assistance. If you are not personally involved in a collision, you should stop to offer help if police or other officials have not arrived.\n\nIn a collision with injuries, possible fuel leaks or serious vehicle damage, stay calm and follow these steps:\n\n1. Call for Help:\nCall for help or have someone else call. By law, you must report any collision to the police when there are injuries or damage to vehicles or other property exceeding $2,000.\n\n2. Secure the Scene:\nTurn off all engines and turn on emergency flashers. Set up warning signals or flares, or have someone warn approaching drivers. This prevents secondary collisions.\n\n3. Fire Safety:\nDo not let anyone smoke, light a match or put flares near any vehicle, in case of a fuel leak. If a vehicle is on fire, get the people out and make sure everyone is well out of the way. If there is no danger of fire or explosion, leave injured people where they are until trained medical help arrives.\n\n4. First Aid Response:\nIf you are trained in first aid, treat injuries in the order of urgency, within the level of your training. For example, clear the person's airway to restore breathing, give rescue breathing or stop bleeding by applying pressure with a clean cloth.\n\nIf you are not trained in first aid, use common sense. For example, people in collisions often go into shock. Cover the person with a jacket or blanket to reduce the effects of shock.\n\n5. Stay with Victims:\nStay with injured people until help arrives. Provide comfort and reassurance while waiting for emergency services.\n\n6. Vehicle Safety:\nDisabled vehicles on the road may be a danger to you and other drivers. Do what you can to make sure everyone involved in a collision is kept safe.\n\nFirst Aid Priorities:\n- Ensure scene safety first\n- Check for responsiveness\n- Open airway if trained\n- Control serious bleeding\n- Treat for shock\n- Monitor vital signs if trained\n- Provide comfort and reassurance",

      content:
        "Collisions involving only property damage have different procedures than injury collisions, but still require specific legal compliance and information exchange.\n\nProperty Damage Collision Steps:\nFollow these steps in a collision where there are no injuries:\n\n1. Move Vehicles Safely:\nIf the vehicles are drivable, move them as far off the road as possible as this should not affect the police officer's investigation. This is especially important on busy or high-speed roads where it may be dangerous to leave vehicles in the driving lanes. So in a minor collision with no injuries, if you can 'Steer it, Clear it.' If you cannot move the vehicles off the road, set up warning signals or flares far enough away to give other traffic time to slow down or stop.\n\n2. Call Police:\nCall police (provincial or local, depending on where the collision takes place). By law, you must report any collision to the police when there are injuries or damage to vehicles or property exceeding $2,000.\n\n3. Provide Information:\nGive all possible help to police or anyone whose vehicle has been damaged. This includes giving police your name and address, the name and address of the registered owner of the vehicle, the vehicle plate and permit number and the liability insurance card.\n\n4. Collect Witness Information:\nGet the names, addresses and phone numbers of all witnesses. Witness testimony can be crucial for insurance claims and legal proceedings.\n\n5. Minor Damage Protocol:\nIf damage is less than $2,000, you are still required by law to exchange information with anyone whose vehicle has been damaged. However, the collision does not have to be reported to the police.\n\n6. Document the Scene:\nIf you have a camera or cell phone with a camera and it is safe to do so, take photos of the collision scene. Document vehicle positions, damage, road conditions, and any relevant details.\n\n7. Towing Information:\nIf your vehicle must be towed, get the name and licence number of the tow truck operator and/or company. Make sure you understand where your vehicle is being towed.\n\n8. Insurance Contact:\nContact your insurance company as soon as possible if you intend to make a claim.\n\nRequired Information Exchange:\n- Full name and address\n- Driver's licence number\n- Vehicle registration information\n- Insurance company and policy number\n- Vehicle plate number\n- Contact information",
