          "Ontario Driver's Licence Requirements:\nAll drivers in Ontario should have a one-piece licence card with photograph and signature. You must carry your licence with you whenever you drive and produce it when a police officer requests it.\n\nLicence Renewal Process:\nYou will get a renewal application form in the mail. Take the form to any ServiceOntario Centre where they will take photographs. You will be asked to sign the form, show identification, pay a fee and have your photograph taken. You will get a temporary licence on the spot if your application and documents are in order, and your permanent one will be mailed to you.\n\nIf you do not get a renewal application form when your licence is due for renewal, call the Ministry of Transportation. You are responsible for making sure you have a valid driver's licence. You can renew an expired car or motorcycle driver's licence within one year without taking any tests.\n\nRe-application Requirements:\nIf your licence has been suspended, cancelled or expired for more than three years, you will be required to re-apply for a licence in Ontario and meet all the requirements of graduated licensing, including passing all the required tests.\n\nSenior Drivers (Age 80 or Older):\nIf you are 80 years of age or older, you are required to renew your driver's licence every two years. This renewal process helps keep seniors mobile and independent longer, while helping to ensure that unsafe drivers are identified and appropriate actions are taken.\n\nSenior Driver Renewal Requirements:\n• Undergo a driving-record review\n• Complete a vision test\n• Participate in a 45-minute group education session\n• Complete an in-class screening component\n• May be required to pass a road test\n• May need to submit medical information\n\nThere is no charge for any of the licence-renewal requirements. You only have to pay the licence-renewal fee.\n\nHow Aging Affects Driving Safety:\n• Reduced vision - especially at night\n• Difficulty judging distance and speed\n• Limited movement and range of motion\n• Slower reaction time\n• Difficulty focusing attention for long periods\n• Easily distracted\n• More time needed to understand what you see and hear\n• More use of prescription and over-the-counter drugs that may impair driving\n\nSafety Tips for Senior Drivers:\n• Check with doctor or pharmacist about medication effects\n• Report vision changes, dizziness, or pain to your doctor\n• Avoid driving when experiencing pain\n• Have hearing and eyes checked regularly\n• Follow exercise programs to maintain flexibility and strength\n• Consider taking a driver's course to refresh knowledge\n\nChanging Name or Address:\nYou must tell the Ministry of Transportation within six days of changing your name or address. When you change your address, you can do this on the ServiceOntario website, at a Driver and Vehicle Licence Issuing Office, or by mail. When your name changes, take required documents and your current licence to a Driver and Vehicle Licence Issuing Office. There is no charge for getting a new licence because you change your name or address.\n\nGraduated Licensing Requalification:\nNovice drivers have five years to complete the graduated-licensing process. If your Class G1, G2 or M2 licence is about to expire and you have not completed the process, you can regain or retain the same class of licence by passing a test and paying the five-year licensing fee. This is called 'requalification.'",

        content:
          "Types of Licence Suspensions:\nTo promote safe driving, Ontario has strict driving laws with lengthy suspensions for various offences including impaired driving, careless driving, stunt driving, and fleeing police. Court sanctions can include fines in tens of thousands of dollars, reinstatement fees, licence restrictions, lifetime bans and jail time.\n\nEscalating Sanctions for Novice Drivers:\nEscalating sanctions apply within a five-year period for:\n• Any repeat violations of novice restrictions\n• Any HTA convictions for four or more demerit points\n• Court-ordered licence suspensions\n\nDangerous Behaviours Sanctions:\nThe risk of fatality or serious injury is almost five times greater for vehicles crashing at 50 km/h or more above posted highway limits.

Violation results in 24-hour roadside driver-licence suspension. If convicted, you face a fine and at least a 30-day licence suspension.\n\nMedical Suspensions:\nAll doctors must report names and addresses of everyone 16 years or older who has a condition that may affect their ability to drive safely (stroke, heart condition, dizziness, etc.). Your driver's licence may be suspended until new medical evidence shows the condition does not pose a safety risk.\n\nMandatory HTA Suspensions:\nYour licence will be suspended:\n• If you fail to stop for a police officer (minimum five years)\n• If you don't pay a traffic fine when ordered by the court\n\nAdministrative Driver's Licence Suspension (ADLS):\nYour licence will be suspended immediately for 90 days if:\n• Your BAC is more than 80 milligrams in 100 millilitres of blood (.08)\n• You fail or refuse to give breath, blood, oral fluid or urine sample when asked\n• You fail or refuse to perform physical co-ordination tests or submit to drug evaluation\n\nWarn-Range Suspensions:\nDrivers with BAC in warn range (.05 to .08) receive immediate roadside suspension:\n• Three days for first occurrence\n• Seven days for second occurrence, plus remedial alcohol-education program\n• Substantially increased penalties for subsequent occurrences\n\nCriminal Code Suspensions:\nYou will receive a one-year licence suspension the first time you are convicted of a Criminal Code offence. Subsequent offences increase substantially to a lifetime ban. Convictions remain on your driver's record for minimum 10 years.\n\nSuspension offences include:\n• Driving with BAC more than .08\n• Refusing to submit to breath test\n• Failing to remain at scene of collision\n• Dangerous driving\n• Causing death or bodily harm by criminal negligence\n• Failing to stop for police\n\nVehicle-Impoundment Program:\nSeven-day vehicle impoundments for:\n• Drivers operating while under HTA licence suspension\n• Drivers caught without required ignition interlock\n• All drivers caught with BAC over .08, or who fail/refuse to comply with Criminal Code demands\n\nIf caught driving while licence suspended for Criminal Code offence, vehicle impounded for minimum 45 days.

        content:
          "Understanding Impaired Driving:\nDriving when your ability is impaired by alcohol or a drug is a crime in Canada. Your vehicle does not have to be moving; you can be charged if you are impaired behind the wheel, even if you have not started to drive.\n\nPolice Testing Requirements:\nIn circumstances involving possible impairment, police can require a driver to:\n• Provide breath samples\n• Perform standardized field sobriety tests\n• Conduct a drug recognition evaluation\n• Provide oral fluid, urine or blood samples for screening\n\nIf you fail or refuse to comply with any of these demands, you will be charged under the Criminal Code.\n\nAlcohol Testing and Enforcement:\nThe police can stop any driver to determine if alcohol or drug testing is required. They may also do roadside spot checks. When stopped, you may be told to blow into a roadside screening device or perform physical co-ordination tests.\n\nIf you cannot give a breath sample or it is impractical to obtain one, the police officer can require you to provide a blood sample instead. Police may also require blood, oral or urine samples.\n\nDrug Impairment:\nCriminal Code and HTA sanctions apply to drivers impaired by alcohol or drugs. Police can require drivers to perform physical co-ordination tests and submit to drug evaluation, then require blood, oral fluid or urine samples.\n\nPrescription and Over-the-Counter Drug Considerations:\n• Ask your doctor about side effects like dizziness, blurred vision, nausea or drowsiness\n• Read information on over-the-counter medicine packages\n• Drugs and any amount of alcohol together can have dangerous effects, even days after taking the drug\n• Do not take chances - ask your doctor or pharmacist\n\nConsequences of Impaired Driving:\nOntario leads North America in combating drinking and driving through tough laws and programs including licence suspensions, heavy fines, vehicle impoundment, mandatory alcohol-education and treatment programs, and ignition interlock program.\n\nPenalty escalation based on convictions:\n• First conviction: up to $2,000 fine, licence suspension\n• Multiple convictions: up to $50,000 fine, jail time, permanent licence loss\n• Impaired driving causing bodily harm: up to 14 years in prison\n• Impaired driving causing death: life imprisonment\n\nAdditional Consequences:\n• Insurance may not pay for medical, rehabilitation or vehicle damage costs\n• Insurance costs may rise significantly\n• Substantial legal costs\n• Employment loss if driving required for job\n• Criminal record affecting travel and employment\n\nRemedial Measures:\nMandatory Back on Track program for all drivers convicted of impaired, driving-related Criminal Code offences. Drivers with more than one 'Warn Range' conviction required to take alcohol-education and/or treatment program.\n\nIf your licence has been suspended because of Criminal Code conviction, your licence will remain suspended until you have completed remedial requirements.\n\nDriver-Improvement Interview:\nRequired for drivers convicted of non-drinking-and-driving Criminal Code offences who have no previous alcohol-related convictions. Must undergo Ministry of Transportation driver-improvement interview.\n\nDriving Under Suspension:\nYou may not drive under any circumstances when your licence is suspended. Convicted of driving while suspended for HTA offence: fines in thousands of dollars and up to six months in jail. For Criminal Code suspensions: fines of tens of thousands of dollars and jail time.",

          "Vehicle Requirements: Insurance, Registration & Maintenance Standards",
        content:
          "Compulsory Auto Insurance:\nOntario has compulsory automobile insurance. Every vehicle registered in the province must be insured. You must show proof of insurance coverage before you can register a vehicle or renew your registration.\n\nVehicle Registration:\nVehicle registration includes licence plates and a vehicle permit. Licence plates in Ontario are based on a plate-to-owner system. This means vehicle licence plates move with the vehicle owner, not the vehicle. When you sell or change vehicles, you must remove your plates.\n\nNew Residents:\nNew Ontario residents have 30 days to register their vehicles. To get a permit and Ontario licence plates, go to ServiceOntario centre with:\n• Safety standards certificate\n• Proof of insurance\n• Vehicle Import Forms (if from another country)\n• Vehicle permit/ownership from previous jurisdiction\n\nVehicle Maintenance Requirements:\nIt is illegal to drive a vehicle in dangerous condition. A police officer or Ministry of Transportation inspector can examine your vehicle, its equipment and any trailer at any time. If found unsafe, it may be taken off the road until repaired.\n\nDaily Driver Habits - Check for:\n• Fresh damage\n• Fluid leaks underneath\n• Under-inflated or flat tires\n• Ajar doors, hood, trunk and fuel cap\n• Unsecured loads\n• Ice, snow, or dirt on lights or windows\n• Unobstructed visibility around entire vehicle\n• Burned-out or dim headlights\n• Illuminated dashboard warning lights\n• Loose objects in vehicle\n\nWhile Driving - Be Alert For:\n• Unusual engine or exhaust noises\n• Squeaking or grinding noises when braking\n• Dashboard warning lights coming on\n\nExtended Trip Preparations:\n• Check windshield wipers and washer-fluid level\n• Check tire pressures, condition and wear\n• Ensure all lights work\n• Check oil and coolant levels when engine cold\n• Look for defects with belts, hoses, and leaks\n• Have vehicle thoroughly inspected by qualified mechanic\n\nTire Requirements:\n• Tires must meet Canadian Motor Vehicle Safety Act standards\n• Replace when tread is less than 1.5 millimetres deep\n• Vehicles over 4,500 kg must replace front tires when tread less than 3mm\n• Replace tires with bumps, bulges, knots, exposed cords or deep cuts\n• Use similar tires on all four wheels\n• Four winter or all-weather tires recommended for winter\n• Northern Ontario can legally use studded tires\n• Tires should not be older than 10 years\n\nWinter Maintenance:\nCarry emergency supplies:\n• Shovel\n• Booster cables\n• Emergency flares or warning lights\n• Blanket\n• Chain for towing\n• Extra windshield washer fluid\n\nFaulty exhaust systems especially dangerous in winter when windows and vents more likely to be closed. Have exhaust checked if it sounds noisy or rattles.\n\nAuto Insurance Fraud Protection:\nWhen buying insurance, use licensed company, agent or broker. After collision, collect as much information as possible and take photos. Be suspicious of referrals pressuring you to use particular services. Refuse to sign blank forms and demand detailed bills.",

          "Towing Regulations: Trailer Requirements & Safe Towing Practices",
        content:
          "Licence and Permit Requirements:\nYou must have a valid driver's licence (Class G1, G2 or G) or higher to tow a trailer with gross vehicle weight up to 4,600 kilograms. If your trailer and load exceeds size and weight specified in Highway Traffic Act, you may need a higher class licence or oversize vehicle permit.\n\nIt is against the law to tow more than one trailer behind non-commercial vehicles.\n\nTrailer Registration:\nA trailer is considered a separate vehicle. Before towing on any public road, you must register it and pay a one-time registration fee at ServiceOntario centre. You will receive a licence plate and vehicle permit. Attach licence plate to back of trailer where clearly visible. Always carry permit or copy to show police when asked.\n\nTrailer Safety Requirements:\nYour trailer must be in safe operating condition. If not, police may remove it from road until made safe.\n\nBrakes: If trailer has gross weight of 1,360 kilograms or more, it must have brakes strong enough to stop and hold the trailer.\n\nLights Required:\n• White licence plate light\n• Red tail light\n• Two red reflectors at rear, as far apart as possible\n• If wider than 2.05 metres: two yellow clearance lights at front, two red clearance lights at rear\n\nMud guards, fenders and flaps required or designed not to spray traffic behind.\n\nTrailer Hitch and Attachment:\nTrailer must have two separate ways of attaching to vehicle so if one fails, trailer stays attached. If using safety chains, they must be crossed under tongue to prevent tongue dropping if primary hitch disconnects. Chain hooks must have latches preventing accidental detachment.\n\nUse good-quality trailer hitch appropriate for gross weight of trailer. Hitch-ball should be installed level when trailer attached and tightened. If hitch pulls down rear of vehicle, may need load-equalizing hitch or shift load in trailer toward rear.\n\nLoading Your Trailer:\nStrap everything down inside and outside. Do not overload trailer. Generally, more trailer load should be in front of axle than behind for proper hitch weight. About 5-10% of trailer's total weight should be supported on hitch, within weight limit marked on hitch.\n\nPoor load balance can cause trailer to sway or fishtail. Heavy and improperly placed loads can pull down rear of vehicle, lifting front end and affecting steering.\n\nSafe Towing Techniques:\nBefore each trip, check trailer hitch, wheels, tires, lights, load distribution and security.\n\nCurves and Turns: Stay close to middle of lane. For sharp right turns, move ahead until front wheels well ahead of curb before turning. For left turns, swing wide by driving well into intersection before turning.\n\nSlowing and Stopping: Sudden stops can cause jackknifing or sliding. Increase following distance and avoid fast lanes. Maintain speed allowing smooth stops.\n\nPassing: Cannot accelerate as quickly when towing. Need more space due to increased length. Allow more room before moving back to lane after passing.\n\nBeing Passed: If holding up traffic, pull over and let vehicles pass. Large trucks create strong air disturbance that may whip trailer sideways.\n\nBacking Up: Back up very slowly with someone directing. Use series of small turns. To back right, steer left; to back left, steer right.\n\nNo Passengers: You may not carry any person in any trailer, including house or boat trailer, when being towed.\n\nTowing Disabled Vehicles:\nUse tow truck designed for towing. If must use another vehicle, use warning signals and attach vehicles securely. Someone must sit in disabled vehicle to use brakes. Don't tow vehicles with power braking/steering if engine cannot run.",

The Level Two (G2) road test gives you full Class G driving privileges and deals with advanced knowledge and skills gained through driving experience.\n\nExpressway Driving Component:\nThe G2 road test includes expressway driving. You must complete and sign a 'Declaration of Highway Driving Experience' ensuring sufficient expressway driving experience. You must indicate how many times in three months before the road test you drove on freeways/highways with speed limits of at least 80 km/h, and average length of these trips.\n\nFreeways include: 400, 401, 402, 403, 404, 405, 406, 407, 409, 410, 416, 417, 420, 427, Queen Elizabeth Way, Don Valley Parkway, Gardiner Expressway, E. C. Row Expressway, and Conestoga Parkway.\n\nIf you do not have sufficient highway driving experience, the examiner must declare the road test 'out-of-order' and cancel it. You will lose 50% of your prepaid road-test fee.\n\nTemporary G Road Test Modifications:\nUntil further notice, the G road test will not include these elements already covered in G2 test:\n• Parallel parking\n• Roadside stops\n• 3-point turn\n• Driving in residential neighbourhoods\n\nThe test still includes fundamental elements:\n• Driving on major roads and expressways including merging\n• Maintaining appropriate speed and space\n• Signalling and lane changes\n• Turns, curves and intersections\n• Driving in business areas\n\nKey Driving Tasks and Requirements:\n\nLeft and Right Turns:\n• Traffic check before slowing down\n• Move into appropriate lane when clear\n• Signal before slowing (unless vehicles at entrances between you and intersection)\n• Steadily reduce speed\n• Maintain 2-3 second following distance\n• Come to complete stop if required\n• Use both hands on steering wheel during turn\n• Don't shift gears during turn (manual transmission)\n• Turn at steady speed, increasing as you complete turn\n\nFreeway Driving:\n• Check mirrors and blind spots while on entrance ramp\n• Signal when freeway traffic can see your vehicle\n• Maintain 2-3 second following distance\n• Match speed of freeway traffic in acceleration lane\n• Merge smoothly into centre of nearest lane\n• Cancel signal after merging\n• Check mirrors every 5-10 seconds while driving\n• Avoid exceeding speed limit or driving unreasonably slowly\n• Keep space on both sides when possible\n\nLane Changes:\n• Check all around while waiting for space\n• Signal when enough space available\n• Check blind spot before moving\n• Maintain proper following distance\n• Change lanes with smooth, gradual movement\n• Use both hands on steering wheel\n• Cancel signal after lane change\n\nGeneral Test Requirements:\n• Follow examiner's directions\n• Demonstrate safe and legal driving practices\n• Show consideration for other road users\n• Maintain vehicle control at all times\n• Observe traffic signs and signals\n• Check mirrors frequently\n• Signal intentions clearly and early\n• Maintain appropriate speeds for conditions",
