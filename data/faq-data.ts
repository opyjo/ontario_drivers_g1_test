    question: "How should I create a study schedule for the G1 test?",
    answer:
      "Recommended study schedule: Week 1-2: Complete study guide chapters 1-4, Week 3-4: Study chapters 5-8 and start practice questions, Week 5-6: Finish remaining chapters and take practice tests regularly, Week 7: Focus on weak areas identified in practice tests, Week 8: Take timed tests and final review. Adjust timing based on your learning pace and confidence level.",

    question: "What should I expect on G1 test day?",
    answer:
      "On test day: arrive early with required identification, bring required fees (if applicable), expect a vision test first, then the 40-question knowledge test on a computer, allow 30 minutes for the knowledge portion, stay calm and read questions carefully, and you'll get your results immediately. If you pass, you'll receive your G1 license and can schedule your road test.",
