# Quiz System Implementation

This document outlines the implementation of the G1 driving test quiz system.

## Overview

The quiz system supports three main types of quizzes:

1. **Signs Practice** - Unlimited practice with road signs questions
2. **Rules Practice** - Unlimited practice with rules of the road questions
3. **G1 Simulation** - Full G1 test simulation (20 signs + 20 rules, timed)

## G1 Test Configuration

- **Questions**: 20 signs + 20 rules = 40 total
- **No Time Limit**: G1 test is not timed
- **Passing Score**: 80% (32 out of 40 questions)
- **Question Sources**: `signs_questions` and `rules_questions` tables

## Getting Started

1. Ensure all dependencies are installed
2. Database schema is set up with quiz tables
3. Follow the implementation stages in order
4. Test each stage before proceeding

## Development Guidelines

- Use TypeScript for all code
- Follow the established patterns from existing components
- Ensure accessibility compliance
- Test on mobile and desktop
- Maintain responsive design principles
